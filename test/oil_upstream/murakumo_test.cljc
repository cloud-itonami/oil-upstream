  "Invariants of the pure cljc actor boundary.

  The one this suite exists for is fail-closed planning: `cell-plan` must not
  emit a single `:mst/put-record` effect unless every gate in `common-gates`
  is attested. Everything else here — the four attestation shapes, the rkey
  derivation, the spec catalogue — is a way that invariant can be lost
  quietly, so each is pinned by name rather than by the aggregate outcome.

  Before this file, `src/oil_upstream/murakumo.cljc` had never been executed
  on any runtime: the repo carried no test/, no deps.edn, no nbb.edn and no
  package.json. Every claim about its gate was true only by inspection."
